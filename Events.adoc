=== Wednesday, 8th June: Berlin DevOps

The most exciting event for Devops professionals in Berlin is back!! 
We are planning another event to welcome spring in Berlin with some exciting talks about Devops. 
The event would be hosted by Forto and they are excited to welcome you in person to their wonderful Headquarters. 
We will soon announce the agenda for the evening. 
However, we are still open for applications for talks and encourage anyone with a story to tell, to use our Google Form and apply. 
Don't be shy, you are among friends 😀
